    <string name="life_intro">The most common introduction of Ertugrul is the father of Osman I, the founder of the Great Ottoman Empire. He was the son of Suleyman Shah, leader of the Kayı tribe of Oghuz Turks, who fled from eastern Iran to Anatolia to escape the Mongol conquests.\n\n Mongol were at their peak under the command of Khan of Khans, Genghis Khan. After the death of his Sulyman Shah, Ertuğrul and his followers entered the service of the Alā ad-Dīn Kayqubād bin Kaykāvūs, Seljuq Sultan of Rûm.\n\n Sultan rewarded him later with the town of Söğüt on the frontier with the Byzantine Empire. This set off the chain of events that would ultimately lead to the founding of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n Ertuğrul is referred to as a Ghazi, a heroic champion fighter for the cause of Islam.</string>

    <string name="Oghuz_turks">
        This small Nomadic tribe also known as the "Oghuz Turks". Their main occupation was robbery, but after they embraced Islam, they became honest and started livelihood by grazing livestock, trading goods and hunting.\n\n Their bravery and turbulent were mentioned in the writings of the historians from Manchuria province of China to far off Morocco. Before accepting Islam even they didn\ t fear striking the dignity and reputation of the Seljuk empire.\n\n They were able to create terror by capturing Seljuk Sultan Ahmed Sanjar in 1153. But after the rise of their cousin Genghis Khan, when the other Tribes were captured by their Mongol cousins but this Tribe was always out of the reach of Mongol Hordes.\n\n At first they left their territories and moved towards to Iran and Khorasan. But Genghis Khan\ s army also chased them there.So they moved to Armenia from there they moved to Asia Minor (Anatolia) then they started living under the patronage of Sultan Alā ad-Dīn Kayqubād in a green grassy land.\n\n They were so brave so Sultan Alā ad-Dīn Kayqubād listed them as a Mercenaries to fight Mongol hordes and Crusaders. Oghuz warriors served in almost all Islamic armies of the Middle East from the 1000s onwards, in Byzantium from the 800s, and even in Spain and Morocco.\n\n The founders of the Ottoman Empire were descendants of the Oguz Yabgu State. Today the residents of Turkey, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Khorezm, Turkmens of Afghanistan, Gagauzia and Iranian Azerbaijan are descendants of Oghuz Turks.\n\n Their language belongs to the Oghuz (a.k.a. southwestern Turkic) group of the Turkic languages family. According to Khazar sources, Oghuzes are the seventh son of Togarmah related to Gog and Magog.</string>

    <string name="Kayi_tribe">The Kayı tribe was an Oghuz Turkic people tribe. The word kayı means \"the one who has might and power by relationship\".\n\n According to Ottoman tradition, Osman I, founder of Ottoman Empire, was descended from the Kayı tribe.\n\n In 1227, Ertugrul inherited the command of the Kayı tribe of the Oghuz Turks as a result of his assistance to the Seljuks against the Byzantines.</string>

The town of Söğüt celebrates an annual festival to the memory of the early Osmans.</string>

    <string name="Legacy">Suljuk Sultan, Ala Ad Din in recognition of the services of Ertugrul,
    granted him land in Sogut, modern day Turkey. Ertugrul then established a town there.\n\n Söğüt
    was known as Thivasio until it was conquered by Ertuğrul Gazi in 1231. In 1299, his son Osman I
    declared independence from the ruling Selçuk Turks, thus founding the Ottoman Empire and
    becoming the first Ottoman sultan.\n\n Söğüt was the Ottoman capital until 1325 when it moved to
    Bursa. There is an monument of Ertugrul Gazi there.

    <string name="mongol_wars">The Mongols conquered, either by force or voluntary submission, the areas today known as Iran, Iraq, Caucasus and parts of Syria and Turkey, with further Mongol raids reaching southwards into the Palestine region as far as Gaza in 1260 and 1300. The major battles were the Siege of Baghdad (1258), when the Mongols sacked the city, which for 500 years had been the center of Islamic power.\n\n The Mongols invaded and destroyed Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus, before invading Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria, and others. Over the course of three years (1237–1240), the Mongols destroyed and annihilated all of the major cities of Russia with the exceptions of Novgorod and Pskov.\n\n
        Led by Genghis Khan and his sons and grandsons, the Mongols briefly ruled most of modern-day Russia, China, Korea, southeast Asia, Persia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe. They reshaped world geography, culture and history in ways that still resound today.\n\n
        Duwa was active in Afghanistan, and attempted to extend Mongol rule into India. The Muslim Negudari governor Abdullah, who was a son of Chagatai Khan s great grandson, invaded Punjab with his force in 1292, but their advance guard under Ulghu was defeated and taken prisoner by the Khalji Sultan, Sultan Jalaluddin.

    <string name="sulj_mongol_wars">Map of Suljuk Empire controlled by Mongols. The control of Anatolia was then split between the Greek states and the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, with the Byzantine holdings gradually being reduced.\n\n The Mongol Empire conquered Persia in 1230; Chormaqan became military governor. There were then no hostilities with the Seljuk Turks. Ala al-Din Kayqubad I and his immediate successor Giyath al-Din Kaykhusraw II swore an oath of vassalage with the payment of at least token tribute to the Great Khan Ögedei.\n\n However, in 1238 the Mongols raided part of Greater Armenia, which was a vassal of the Sultanate of Rum. Ögedei died in 1241, and Kaykhusraw took the opportunity to repudiate his vassalage, believing he was strong enough to resist the Mongols. Chormaqan\ s successor Baiju Noyan summoned him to renew his submission: go to Mongolia in person, give hostages, and accept a Mongol darughachi(Governorship). When the Sultan refused, Baiju Noyan declared war.\n\n

    <string name="turk_wars">
        First of all, Mongols and Turks lived together for a long time. During the time of Xiongnu Empire, Mongols and Turks were not divided yet. East and North of Xiongnu was inhabited by Mongols. Todays Mongolia was inhabited by Turks.
        \n\n
        From 1221 to 1327, the Mongol Empire launched several invasions into the Indian subcontinent. The Mongols occupied parts of modern Pakistan and other parts of Punjab for decades. However, they failed to penetrate past the outskirts of Delhi and were repelled from the interior of India. Centuries later, the Mughal Empire, with Mongol roots from Central Asia, conquered the northern part of the sub-continent.\n\n
        In 1243, Turkish Seljuk sultans were defeated in Anatolia by Mongols, following that majority of turks stayed under rule of Mongolian Ilkhanate until the rebellion of Osman I in 1320, who then founded the Ottoman empire. Its more like Turks and Mongols were rivals and clashed several times during the stretch of time.\n\n

    <string name="final_battle">
        \n\n The Seljuks invaded the Kingdom of Georgia, part of the Mongol Empire. Baiju Noyan\ s army attacked Karin in relation to Kaykhusraw\ s disobedience in 1241. Before attacking, Baiju Noyan demanded submission. The inhabitants of the city insulted the Mongol envoy sent by him. Since the city decided to resist and defied Mongol diplomacy, the Mongols besieged it.\n\n In two months, the Mongols took Karin and punished its residents. Aware of the Seljuk power in Anatolia, Noyan returned to the Mugan plain without advancing further. Baiju advanced to Erzurum with a contingent of Georgian and Armenian warriors under Awag and Shansheh in 1243. They besieged the city of Erzurum when its governor Yakut refused to surrender it. With the power of twelve catapults, Baiju stormed Erzurum.\n \n When the reports of the attack on Erzurum reported to him, Kaykhusraw summoned his armed forces at Konya. He accepted the challenge by sending a war message, defying Baiju that his army took only one of his many cities. The Seljuk Sultan made an alliance with all nations surrounding him. The King of Lesser Armenia (Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia) promised him to send a contingent; however, it is not certain they really engaged in his struggle with the Mongols.\n \n Kaykhusraw received the military support from the Empire of Trebizond and the Ayyubid Sultan at Aleppo, and the Frankish mercenaries participated in the campaign. Because of little reliable information, it is difficult to measure the opposing troops.\n \n Kaykhusraw advanced from Konya some 200 miles up to Köse Dağ. The Mongolian army entered the area in June 1243 and awaited the march of the Seljuks and their allies. The early stage of the battle was indecisive. The Sultan\ s forces suffered the greater casualties and he decided to withdraw at night.\n \n Pursuing him, Baiju Noyan received the submission of Erzinjan, Divrigi and Sivas en route.  The Mongols set up their camp near Sivas. When the Mongols penetrated into Kayseri, it chose to resist them. After a short resistance, it fell to the invaders. Hearing of the disaster at Köse Dağ, Hethum I of Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia quickly made his peace with the Mongols in 1243 and sent his brother Sembat to the Mongol court of Karakorum in 1247 to negotiate an alliance with the Mongolian Emperor Güyük. Kaykhusraw sent a delegation headed by his vizier to Baiju, realizing the further resistance would only produce a great disaster.\n \n Baiju Noyan offered terms based on resubmission and the Sultan was undertaken to pay a tribute tax every year in gold, silk, camel and sheep of uncertain quantities. However, the Turkish realm that had been taken by the military force remained occupied by the Mongols. Almost half of the Sultanate of Rum became an occupied country. The Empire of Trebizond became subject to the Mongolian Qaghan, fearing of the potential punitive expedition because they involved in the battle of Köse Dağ.

    <string name="selj_fall">
        The Seljuk Empire in Persia was at its peak during the reign of Alp Arsalan and his son Malik Shah. With the death of Malik Shah, began the decline of this great empire. The borders of the Seljuk Sultanate were under constant pressure from the Crusaders in the west, the Arabs in the south and the Mongols in the east.\n\n
The Battle of Köse Dağ was fought between the Sultanate of Rum ruled by the Seljuq dynasty and the Mongol Empire on June 26, 1243 at the defile of Köse Dağ, a location between Erzincan and Gümüşhane in modern northeastern Turkey.\n\n
  he decisive battle was fought at Köse Dağ on June 26, 1243. The primary sources do not record the size of the opposing armies but suggest that the Mongols faced a numerically superior force.\n\n
        The defeat resulted in a period of turmoil in Anatolia and led directly to the decline and disintegration of the Seljuq state. The Empire of Trebizond became a vassal state of the Mongol empire. Furthermore, the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia became a vassal state of the Mongols. Real power over Anatolia was exercised by the Mongols.\n\n

    <string name="defeat_mongol">The Battle of Ain Jalut: When Möngke Khan became Great Khan in 1251, he immediately set out to implement his grandfather Genghis Khan\ s plan for world empire. To lead the task of subduing the nations of the West, he selected his brother, another of Genghis Khan\ s grandsons, Hulagu Khan.\n\n
    In 1260, Hulagu sent envoys to Qutuz in Cairo, demanding his surrender:\n\n
“	From the King of Kings of the East and West, the Great Khan. To Qutuz the Mamluk, who fled to escape our swords. You should think of what happened to other countries and submit to us. You have heard how we have conquered a vast empire and have purified the earth of the disorders that tainted it. We have conquered vast areas, massacring all the people. You cannot escape from the terror of our armies. Where can you flee? What road will you use to escape us? Our horses are swift, our arrows sharp, our swords like thunderbolts, our hearts as hard as the mountains, our soldiers as numerous as the sand. Fortresses will not detain us, nor armies stop us. Your prayers to God will not avail against us. We are not moved by tears nor touched by lamentations. Only those who beg our protection will be safe. Hasten your reply before the fire of war is kindled. Resist and you will suffer the most terrible catastrophes. We will shatter your mosques and reveal the weakness of your God and then will kill your children and your old men together. At present you are the only enemy against whom we have to march.	”
   \n\n
        Shortly before the battle, Hulagu withdrew from the Levant with the bulk of his army, leaving his forces west of the Euphrates with only one tumen (nominally 10,000 men but usually smaller).\n\n The Mamluk Sultan Qutuz at that time allied with a fellow Mamluk, Baibars, Turks under Ertugrul Gazi, who chose to ally himself with Qutuz in the face of a greater enemy, after the Mongols captured Damascus and most of Bilad al-Sham. \n\n
         When news arrived that the Mongols had crossed the Jordan River, Sultan Qutuz and his forces proceeded southeast toward the spring at Ain Jalut in the Jezreel Valley.\n\n The first to advance were the Mongols, whose force also included troops from the Kingdom of Georgia and about 500 troops from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, both of which had submitted to Mongol authority. \n\n
        The two armies fought for many hours, with Baibars most of the time implementing hit-and-run tactics, in order to provoke the Mongol troops and at the same time preserve the bulk of his troops intact.\n\n
        Some distance away, Qutuz watched with his private legion. When Qutuz saw the left wing of the Mamluk army almost destroyed by the desperate Mongols seeking an escape route, Qutuz threw away his combat helmet, so that his warriors could recognize him.\n\n He was seen the next moment rushing fiercely towards the battlefield yelling "wa islamah!" ("Oh my Islam"), urging his army to keep firm, and advanced towards the weakened side, followed by his own unit.
        \n\n
The Mongols were pushed back and fled to a vicinity of Bisan, followed by Qutuz forces, but they managed to reorganize and return to the battlefield, making a successful counterattack.\n\n Kitbuqa and almost the whole Mongol army that had remained in the region perished. Baibars became the new Sultan.\n\n Local Ayyubid emirs sworn to the Mamluk sultanate subsequently defeated another Mongol force of 6,000 at Homs, which ended the first Mongol expedition into Syria.\n\n Baibars and his successors would go on to capture the last of the Crusader states in The Holy Land by 1291.\n\n

        The Fourth Crusade (1202 to 1204) was a Latin Christian armed expedition called by Pope Innocent III. The majority of the crusading army that set out from Venice in early October 1202 originated from areas within France. \n\n Early in October 1202, a fleet of 200 ships set sail from the lagoon of Venice. The goal of this expedition, this Fourth Crusade, was to win back the holy city of Jerusalem. Conquered by Islamic armies in the 7th century. Jerusalem fell to the Muslim Saladin, the Greatest Sultan of his time, An-Nasir Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub known as Sultan Salah ad-Din Ayoubi in the Muslim World, who then stalemated a recovery attempt by the Third Crusade (1189 to 92). The Fourth Crusade was to follow a new strategy: strike at Egypt, the base of Muslim power. But it never reached its goal. Instead, a bizarre twist of fate turned the latest crusaders in a totally unexpected direction! \n \n They, instead of targeting Islamic cities they attacked another Chirstian city, one of the greatest cities of all times, Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire.\n \n After this attack, The Byzantine Empire never recovered and was finally and forever extinguished by the Turks in 1453. \n \n Almost none of the crusaders ever made it to the Holy Land, and the unstable Latin Empire siphoned off much of the crusading energy of Europe. The legacy of the Fourth Crusade was the deep sense of betrayal the Latins had instilled in their Greek coreligionists.\n \n Turks, after this crusade became much more powerful, actually we can say that their way into Europe was paved by 4th crusade.

The Seljuqs originated from the Qynyk branch of the Oghuz Turks. During the 10th-century migrations of the Turkish peoples from Central Asia and southeast Russia, one group of nomadic tribes, led by a chief named Seljuq.\n\n
        Under the sultans Alp-Arslan and Malik-Shāh, the Seljuq empire was extended to include all of Iran and Mesopotamia and Syria, including Palestine. In 1071 Alp-Arslan defeated an immense Byzantine army at Manzikert and captured the Byzantine emperor Romanus IV Diogenes. The way was open for Turkmen tribesmen to settle in Asia Minor.\n\n
A war against the Khwārezm-Shāh dynasty of Iran instigated in 1230 by the Rūm sultan ʿAlaʾ al-Dīn Kay-Qubādh (Kaikobad) I led ultimately to the disintegration of Rūm and of Seljuq power. \n\n
        At the Battle of Köse Dagh in 1243, Seljuq autonomy was lost forever. A sad end of the Great Seljuk Empire of Rum!

        In 1301, after soundly defeating a Byzantine force near Nikea, Osman began settling his forces closer to Byzantine-controlled areas. Large numbers of Ghazi warriors, Islamic scholars, and dervishes began settling in Osman-controlled areas, and migrants composed the bulk of his army.\n \n The influx of Ghazi warriors and adventurers of differing backgrounds into these lands spurred subsequent Ottoman rulers to title themselves \"Sultan of Ghazis\".  \n Osman\ s last campaign, before dying of old age, was against the Byzantines in the city of Bursa.\n \n Although Osman did not physically participate in the battle, the victory at Bursa proved to be extremely vital for the Ottomans as the city served as a staging ground against the Byzantines in Constantinople, and as a newly adorned capital for Osman\ s son, Orhan.\n\n The Fall of Constantinople was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading Ottoman army on 29 May 1453. The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II, who defeated an army commanded by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that began on 6 April 1453.\n \n After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of his Empire from Edirne to Constantinople and established his court there.  The capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, a continuation of the Roman Empire, an imperial state dating to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.\n \n The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to Christendom, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.

    <string name="ottoman">
        The disintegration of the Seljuk Turks led to the rise of the Ottoman Turks. Their first important leader was Osman I Bey, who attracted Ghazi warriors and carved out a domain in north-western Asia Minor.\n\n Attempts by the Byzantine Emperors to drive back the Ottomans were unsuccessful, and ceased in 1329 with the Battle of Pelekanon.\n\n Following a number of civil disputes in the Byzantine Empire, the Ottomans subjugated the Byzantines as vassals in the late 14th century and attempts to relieve this vassal status culminated in the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.\n\n

    <string name="osman">
Osman is known as the father of the Ottoman Empire as from his Beylik (principality) the expansion of the Ottoman territory began.\n\n In the history books you will often see Ottoman rule referred to as the Osmanli dynasty. Osman came very late to his parents. He was born late in Ertugrul and Halime’s life.\n\n When Osman was born, (1258), Ertugrul was around 67 years old, and as Halime was older too, when normally women cannot have children anymore, he was considered as a Miracle sent by God.\n\n

         There is a well-known story about a sleepless night Osman spent before taking the throne.\n\n One day, when he was 19 years old, his father Ertugrul went to visit a distant friend with his family, where they would remain overnight. The host of the house shows Osman his room and everyone retires for the night. Just after he prepares to go to sleep Osman notices the Qur\ an hanging on the wall.\n\n His respect for the holy book of Islam keeps him from lying down, and as he is a visitor, he cannot take the Qur\ an out of the room. He decides not to sleep until morning and sits beside the sofa. However, he is unable to stay awake and falls asleep for a short time just before dawn.\n \n As he sleeps, he dreams he sees a crescent coming out of the chest of his mentor, Sheikh Edebali, and going into his body. Afterwards an enormous plane tree emerges from his chest and covers all the sky, shading the earth, the people enjoying and benefiting from his shade.\n \n
        He then wakes. When he and his family get back to their village, he recounts this dream to Sheikh Edebali, who smiles after hearing the dream and tells Osman that Allah would grant him and his descendants an enormous empire and he will receive the hand of Sheikh Edebali\ s daughter Mal Hatun in marriage. Because of his loyalty to Islam and his sharpness, courage, and generosity, he was nominated to be the ruler of the Kayi Clan.

        \n\n Ottoman sources often dwell on the prophetic significance of Osman\ s name, which means \"bone-breaker,\" signifying the powerful energy with which he and his followers showed in the following centuries of conquest. The name is also one given to a large species of vulture, commonly called the royal vulture, which is considered the emblem of sovereignty and warlike power in the East, comparable to the eagle in the nations of the West.
        \n\nHistorians consider a black hole in Ottoman history during life of Osman as what is written about him was uncovered 100 years after he died.

He was the Seljuk governor of Jerusalem between 1085–1091.\n\n Artuk Bey lived in Qüddus up to his death in 1091.  Artuk Bey was one of the commanders of the Great Seljuk Empire army during the Battle of Manzikert in 1071.\n\n After the battle, he took part in the conquest of Anatolia on behalf of the Seljuk Empire.\n\n He captured the Yeşilırmak valley in 1074. He also served the sultan by quashing a rebellion in 1077.  His next mission was a campaign to capture Amid (modern Diyarbakır) from the Marwanids.\n\n In this campaign he quarrelled with the Commander in Chief Fahrüddevlet who tended to make peace with Marwanids. In a surprise attack he defeated reinforcements to Marwanids.\n\n However, when the Sultan Malik Shah I heard about the event he suspected Artuk Bey of dissension.  Artuk Bey left the battle field and attended to Tutush I who was Malik Shah’s discordant younger brother in Syria in 1084.\n\n In 1086 he was instrumental in defeating Süleyman, the sultan of Seljuks of Turkey in a battle between Süleyman and Tutush.\n\n  The Beylik of Artukids was named after him, founded 11 years after his death by his sons. His valiant sons are El Gazi ibn Artuk who battled Baldwin II of Edessa at the Battle of Hab, Syria (1119) but lost and Soqman ibn Artuk, the ally of the hot tempered Tugtekin Bey, The Governor of Damascus against the Crusaders in 1104 at the Battle of Harran near Raqqa.\n\n On this battle the Seljuk Army finally captured Crusader Knights Baldwin Il of Edessa who called himself, King of Tripoli and Jerusalem and Joscelin of Courtenay who called himself Prince of Galilee.\n\n Although, they managed to escape later. Soqman ibn Artuk become famous and a true honour to the late Artuk Bey.

        Emir Al-Aziz  of Aleppo  Al Aziz Muhammad ibn Gazi (1213 – 1236) was the Ayyubi Emir of Aleppo and the son of az-Zahir Gazi (r) and grandson of the great Salahuddin Al Ayubi (r), the liberator of Jerusalem from the Crusaders and Templars.\n\n His mother was Dayfa Khatun(r), the daughter of Salahuddin’s brother al-Adil(r). Al-Aziz was aged just three when his father az-Zahir Gazi died in 1216 at the age of forty-five.\n\n He immediately inherited his father’s position as ruler of Aleppo. A regency council was formed, which appointed Shihab ad-Din Tughril(r) as his guardian.\n\n  Tughril was a Mamluk of az-Zahir Gazi and the effective ruler of Aleppo for the next fifteen years.  Al-Aziz did not take actual control of power until the age of seventeen, at which point he retained Tughril as his treasurer.\n\n In general, he avoided becoming drawn into the complex disputes between different members of the Ayyubi dynasty, and concentrated instead on strengthening the defenses and infrastructure of Aleppo.\n\n Among the construction works begun by az-Zahir Gazi and completed by al-Aziz Muhammad were the re-fortification of the citadel, and, within it, the building of the palace, the mosque, the arsenal and the water cisterns.\n\n Al-Aziz is known to have married Fatima Khatun, daughter of al-Kamil, who apparently shared his passion for building and commissioned the construction of two madrasas in Aleppo.\n\n Al-Aziz died on 26 November 1236 at the age of just twenty-three. His eldest son, an-Nasir Yusuf, was only seven years old, so al-Aziz’s mother Dayfa Khatun assumed the regency.\n\n Surprisingly, Al-Aziz’s daughter, Ghaziya Khatun, married the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, Kaykhusraw II (Giyaseddin Ibn Kayqubad)
